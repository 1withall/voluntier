## [Unreleased]

### 2025-10-29 23:00 UTC - Added
- Completed Temporal Phase 2 advanced features (Task 6 - 3 of 4 features):
  - **Child Workflows** (app/workflows/verification_subworkflows.py):
    - DocumentVerificationWorkflow: Document upload + OCR processing with heartbeating
      - Handles passport, drivers_license, national_id documents
      - Multi-page OCR with progress tracking
      - Document validity checking with format validation
      - Evidence storage for compliance audit trails
    - CommunityValidationWorkflow: Multi-validator trust network system
      - Requests validators from user's trust network
      - Receives validator responses via workflow signals
      - Aggregates scores by validator reputation weighting
      - 72-hour timeout with progress queries
    - InPersonVerificationWorkflow: Physical verification scheduling
      - Geospatial search for nearby verifiers
      - Appointment scheduling with availability checks
      - Completion tracking via signals
      - 7-day appointment timeout
    - **7 New Activities** (app/activities/verification.py):
      - extract_document_data: OCR with page-by-page heartbeating
      - check_document_validity: Format and authenticity validation
      - store_verification_evidence: Immutable audit trail storage
      - request_community_validators: Trust network querying
      - aggregate_validation_scores: Reputation-weighted scoring
      - find_available_verifiers: PostGIS geospatial search
      - schedule_verification_appointment: Appointment creation with notifications
  - **Heartbeating** (app/activities/verification.py, app/workflows/verification_subworkflows.py):
    - Enhanced extract_document_data with page-level heartbeating:
      - Processes 3-page passport documents with progress tracking
      - Reports page number, progress percentage, pages completed
      - Resumes from last heartbeat after worker crash using heartbeat_details
      - Detects cancellation with activity.is_cancelled()
    - DocumentVerificationWorkflow configured with heartbeat_timeout=30s
    - Enables real-time progress monitoring for long OCR operations
    - Automatic resumption after transient failures (worker crash, network issues)
  - **Worker Registration** (app/worker.py):
    - Registered 3 child workflows: DocumentVerificationWorkflow, CommunityValidationWorkflow, InPersonVerificationWorkflow
    - Registered 7 new activities for child workflow support
    - Total workflows: 5 (VerificationWorkflow, ReputationDecayWorkflow + 3 child workflows)
    - Total activities: 17 (5 regular + 4 local + 1 reputation + 7 child workflow support)
  - **Examples and Documentation**:
    - app/examples/child_workflows.py (380+ lines):
      - Individual child workflow execution examples
      - Parallel child workflow execution (document + community simultaneously)
      - Integration patterns with parent VerificationWorkflow
      - Client usage examples with signals and queries
    - app/examples/heartbeating.py (420+ lines):
      - Basic heartbeating pattern
      - Document OCR with page-level progress tracking
      - Batch processing with periodic heartbeats
      - Resumption after failure demonstration
  - **Benefits Achieved**:
    - Independent retry policies per verification method (3 attempts for document OCR, 1 for community)
    - Parallel execution of verification paths (document + community run simultaneously)
    - Better workflow history management (each child has own history, prevents parent bloat)
    - Fault isolation (document OCR failure doesn't affect community validation)
    - Real-time progress monitoring (OCR reports page-by-page progress)
    - Automatic crash recovery (resumes from last heartbeat, no data loss)
- **Phase 2 Remaining** (2 of 4 features):
  - Cron Schedules: Daily reputation decay (2 AM UTC), weekly verification reminders
  - Pydantic Converter: Type-safe workflow serialization with automatic validation
- **Phase 2 Completion**: 75% complete (3/4 features implemented and tested)

    - VerificationWorkflow now sets search attributes on start:
      - Initial status: in_progress
      - user_id, target_score, created_at
      - verification_methods_count starts at 0
    - Updates verification_methods_count when methods completed
    - Updates status to "completed" when target score reached
    - Enables queries like: `WorkflowStatus='Running' AND user_id=123`
  - **Worker Integration** (app/worker.py):
